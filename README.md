The goal of this project is to build a simple clone of the AirBnB Website. Below are the features of the project:
-  A Command Interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## Command Intepreter
The Command interpreter runs in 2 modes, the  interactive mode and the non-interactive mode.
### Interactive Mode
You can start the command interpreter in interactive mode by running:
```bash
./console.py
```
### Non-Interactive Mode
To use the command interpreter in non-interactive mode, you have the pip the command into the intepreter. For example:
```bash
echo "help" | ./console.py
```
